# hello-world

Ok. I think I've finally learned to read and am going to get this right. Three trys to do something easy is what I get for doing this during a noisy event at work.
I don't yet know anything about programming, but I've been instructed by someone who does that this is one of the first things I should learn to do. So here I am...learning. :)

This is an edit I'm going to push to git.
